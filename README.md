Abstract

The program has been designed to visualization position of NOAA meteorological satellites.
As a hardware platform was chosen the Raspberry Pi (Pi Zero), cheap minicomputer with relatively
large possibilities. The programming language chosen for the project is Python. The program
presents the position of selected satellites on the world map and in the side panel displays among
others information about geographical coordinates, altitude above the Earth. The application also
allows updating TLE files needed to correctly vizualization the position of the meteorological
satelites.
